# Project_Bike_Share_Analysis
A Jupyter Notebook showcasing an implementation of Bike Share Analysis Project.
Performed an EDA of data provided by Motivateco, a bike-share system provider in the US. 
We compared the system usage by analyzing if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, 
regular users, and those users that are short-term, casual users.
